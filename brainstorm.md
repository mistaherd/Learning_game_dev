# some ideas for up 

- Score track

	- small treasure 1
	- large treasure 10

- Time track 
	take away time each time they look at the treasure map
	take away time each time they dig in the wrong spot
	a way to add time (maybe finding coins or rum?)
	1, 2 or 3 stars depending on time remaining

- Environmental obstacles
	quicksand
	path blockers (rival pirates?)

- Dig minigame

# basic idea
- treasure hunt that is  a  time trial
- treasure map that hints at the location of the treasure by icons, a poem or both
- levels get harder where you only start with half or a quarter of the map and can find the rest of the map in game
